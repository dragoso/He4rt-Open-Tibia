Among others, you can trade Tibia items, advertise ingame events, seek characters for a quest or a hunting group, find members for your guild or look for somebody to help you with something. It goes without saying that all advertisements must conform to the Tibia Rules, e.g. it is illegal to advertise trades including real money.",
